###The goal of this repository is to store code that allows for efficient collection of publically available data on stocks and use machine learning algorithms to predict prices of specific stocks. Ensemble machine learning models were built in an attempt to predict stock prices.  This was a failed experiment, but my personal belief is that we learn from failure as much as from success, so if anyone wants to take on this task where I left off...the code is here for you.

### Data include:
 - Federal Reserve Economic data (e.g. interest rates, exchange rate, commodity prices, industrial production,etc.)
 - Daily stock price for over 4000 stocks
 - Company fincial data on over 4000 companies including: income statements, balance sheets, and statement of cash flows
